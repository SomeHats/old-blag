Ehhhh. I have a new blog. Let’s see how long this thing lasts…

My plan is to keep things updated with weekly posts about [Drum Roll][],
[E.A.K.][], and other projects. <!--more-->I’ll mainly be writing about:

* Technical bits and pieces in E.A.K
* Tricking people into learning things
* Adventures in starting a game company
  * spoilers: it’s really hard and we have no idea what we’re doing

I’ve just spent a couple of hours throwing this whole blog thang
together. It’s powered by [Jekyll][], and the theme is based on
[Poole][]. I’ve ruined Poole with super-geeky monospaced fonts and
[Solarized][] colours.

[E.A.K.]: https://eraseallkittens.com/
[Drum Roll]: http://drumrollhq.com/
[Jekyll]: http://jekyllrb.com/
[Poole]: https://github.com/poole/poole
[Solarized]: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized
