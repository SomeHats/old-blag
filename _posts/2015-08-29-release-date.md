title: 1 Year of Drum Roll
---
Drum Roll is a year old today. It's been a year since I quit my job and started building a game about rescuing cat gifs full time. Realising this makes me feel weird. The last 12 months have gone so fast and been so strange.

The last big update to the E.A.K. demo was released on the 26th of September, 2014. Since then, we've only released tiny tweaks and bug fixes. But on the 28th of September, 2015, we will be releasing the beta version of E.A.K.. This is terrifying. <!--more-->

In the last ~11 months, we've completely reworked almost all of E.A.K.. We learned a huge amount from the demo, applying that to the game has been incredibly difficult. Everything has taken about 3 times as long as we anticipated. Initially, we wanted to release a finished Chapter 1 in March, 2015. HAHAHA NO. Then, we wanted to release a slightly smaller Chapter one in June. We completely missed that too.

This September, we *have* to release *something*. It will be a beta of most of Chapter 1. It will be buggy. Bit's will be missing. But if we don't release it by the end of next month, I'm not sure we ever will.

I've got three big fears at the moment:

1. We don't get enough done in time
2. People see the update as a step in the wrong direction
3. No one gives us any money

1 is fairly self explanatory. We're not going to be releasing a finished product, but I don't want what we do release to be embarrassingly incomplete. The game needs to at least be playable.

2 is a trickier. It probably won't happen. We've done a fair bit of testing with the new way of doing things in E.A.K.. I really hope it doesn't happen.

3 has the biggest implications on the future of E.A.K.. For the first time ever, we're going to be asking E.A.K. fans to support us financially. For the past 6 months, we've been running on fumes. This is an opportunity to show potential investors that people will put their money where their mouth is when it comes to E.A.K..

If no one buys E.A.K., I'm not sure what we do. I guess smother E.A.K. in shitty ads and micro-transactions. I really want to avoid that, but that's where the gaming industry is at right now - especially on phones and tablets, which is where our young target audience is.

After this release, we want to put content out there far more frequently. No more year-long silences whilst we overhaul everthing about the game. We want small incremental updates released as soon as they're ready, and new batches of content every 6-8 weeks.

We'll see how it all works out...
