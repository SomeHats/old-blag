title: E.A.K. Dev Diary 1
---

I created this blog in February, saying I hoped to write one post a week. It's now mid-August. The only post I ever wrote was the "[hey I dun a new blog](/2015/new-blog.html)" one. It seems I'm not very good at this.

The new plan is to do a sort of development diary for [E.A.K](https://eraseallkittens.com). My thinking is that if I can write *something* each week, even just a few lines, I can start to build a habit. We'll see how that goes. Probably badly.

*sigh*

Anyway, this week we've been working on a mini-game to teach about URLs.

In the game, the illegitimate mayor of Ponyhead Bay asks Arca to fetch some objects. The mayor gives you URLs which you have to follow to find the objects. You follow the URLs by first going to towns (domains), then buildings (paths) etc. I want to cover the distinction between `http` and `https` too, but I'm not sure how to make that work yet.

For example, the URL for a jar of pickled onions at Onions-R-Us on Bulbous Island would be `http://bulbous-island.com/onions-r-us/pickled-onions`.

We map abstract concepts from the world of web-literacy to physical objects all the time in E.A.K. It's a great way to keep things engaging, and help make concepts more intuitive. Your metaphors have to break down at some point though - and when they do, they can make things confusing for players.

This is a trade-off I'm not always happy with, but it's necessary to have learning as a side-effect of game-play.

ANYWAY THIS POST HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH DEV STUFF OH WELL HAVE A DEMO VIDEO.
