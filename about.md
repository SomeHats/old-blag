I’m Joe. I’m co-founder / Chief Button Presser of [Drum Roll HQ][], a company
that builds learning games. Our aim is to build games that teach people
stuff almost without them realizing it.

We’re currently developing our flagship game, [Erase All Kittens][].
E.A.K. aims to teach kids to built websites and webapps. Players hack in
to levels written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete the game.
