Hey. I'm Joe.

I'm co-founder / Chief Button Presser of [Drum Roll HQ](http://drumrollhq.com),
a company that builds learning games. Our aim is to build games that teach people
almost without them realising it.

Currently, we're developing our flagship game, [Erase All Kittens](https://eraseallkittens.com).
E.A.K. aims to teach kids to built websites and webapps. Players have to hack
in to levels written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to complete the game.

I plan to update this blog roughly once a week. That probably won't happen. Sigh.
